KiCAD Libraries
===============

Some components for which I created custom kicad lib parts.

Note to myself
--------------

To create a new library part, do these.

- Open EESchema
- Open Library editor (a few buttons to the left of annotation tool with a pen in the icon)
- Create new part
- Create the part
- Select working library/save part to new lib
- Save part to lib
